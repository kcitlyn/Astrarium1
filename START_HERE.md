## Troubleshooting

### Backend won't start
- Make sure you're in the venv: `venv\Scripts\activate`
- Make sure .env file exists in Astrarium_Backend with OPENAI_API_KEY
- Try: `pip install -r requirements.txt` again

### Frontend won't start
- Try: `pnpm install` in Astrarium_Frontend directory
- Check for port conflicts (kill process on port 3000)

### "No pet found" or API errors
- Backend might not be running - check Terminal 1
- Check .env has `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000`
- Try the test page first: `http://localhost:3000/test`

### Signup not working
- Check browser console (F12) for errors
- Check backend terminal for error messages
- Make sure Supabase credentials are in .env
