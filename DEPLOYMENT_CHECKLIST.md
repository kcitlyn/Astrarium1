## Known Limitations

### Backend Auth
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Using basic password hashing (not production-ready)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Auth tokens are simple (not JWT)
- üí° Works for demo, needs upgrade for production

### Session Sync
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Password not stored client-side for re-auth
- üí° May need to re-login after page refresh
- üí° Can be fixed with JWT implementation

### AI Response Time
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Question generation takes 3-5 seconds
- üí° OpenAI API latency
- üí° Consider caching common questions

## Performance Optimizations

### Current
- ‚úÖ Component-level loading states
- ‚úÖ Refresh keys prevent stale data
- ‚úÖ React hooks for efficient updates
- ‚úÖ No unnecessary re-renders

### Future
- [ ] Add React Query for caching
- [ ] Implement optimistic updates
- [ ] Prefetch recommendations
- [ ] Cache generated questions
- [ ] Add service worker for offline

## Production Deployment Considerations

### Security Hardening
- [ ] Implement JWT authentication
- [ ] Add bcrypt password hashing
- [ ] Enable rate limiting
- [ ] Add input sanitization
- [ ] Configure HTTPS only
- [ ] Restrict CORS to specific domains
- [ ] Add API key rotation

### Database
- [ ] Migrate from SQLite to PostgreSQL
- [ ] Set up database backups
- [ ] Add migration system
- [ ] Index frequently queried fields

### Scaling
- [ ] Add Redis for caching
- [ ] Set up load balancer
- [ ] Configure CDN for static assets
- [ ] Implement database connection pooling

### Monitoring
- [ ] Add error tracking (Sentry)
- [ ] Set up logging
- [ ] Add analytics
- [ ] Monitor API usage
- [ ] Track AI costs

### Environment
- [ ] Set up staging environment
- [ ] Configure CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Add automated tests
- [ ] Set up environment variables management

## Demo Day Checklist

### Before Demo
- [ ] Backend running smoothly
- [ ] Frontend loaded in browser
- [ ] Test user account ready
- [ ] Sample skills pre-added
- [ ] Pet visible and healthy
- [ ] Internet connection stable (for AI)
- [ ] Screen sharing tested

### During Demo
- [ ] Show landing page
- [ ] Walk through signup
- [ ] Demonstrate skill addition
- [ ] Show AI recommendations
- [ ] Run live practice session
- [ ] Display pet evolution
- [ ] Highlight streak system
- [ ] Show spaced repetition schedule

### Talking Points
1. "Prevents skill decay using forgetting curve theory"
2. "AI generates personalized questions for any skill"
3. "Spaced repetition like Anki for optimal retention"
4. "Gamification with evolving alien pets"
5. "Built for tech workers who drift between technologies"

## Emergency Troubleshooting

### Backend Won't Start
```bash
# Check Python version
python --version  # Should be 3.10+

# Recreate venv
rm -rf venv
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Frontend Build Errors
```bash
# Clear cache and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules
rm pnpm-lock.yaml
pnpm install
```

### AI Questions Not Generating
1. Check OpenAI API key in `.env`
2. Verify API quota/billing
3. Check backend logs for errors
4. Try with different skill name
5. Fallback: Backend has hardcoded fallback questions

### Database Errors
```bash
# Delete and regenerate
rm astral_pet.db
# Restart backend (auto-creates tables)
```

### CORS Errors
- Check `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` in backend `.env`
- Ensure frontend URL matches exactly
- Restart backend after changes

## Success Criteria

Your demo is ready when:
- ‚úÖ You can signup ‚Üí add skill ‚Üí practice ‚Üí see pet evolve
- ‚úÖ All 3 main views work (Pet, Skills, Recommendations)
- ‚úÖ AI generates questions successfully
- ‚úÖ Pet health changes based on answers
- ‚úÖ UI looks polished with cosmic theme
- ‚úÖ No console errors visible

## Final Notes

**Time to First Demo**: ~5 minutes after install
**Most Impressive Feature**: AI-generated questions for any skill
**Unique Value Prop**: Gamified spaced repetition for skill retention

Good luck! Your cosmic companion awaits! üöÄüåü
