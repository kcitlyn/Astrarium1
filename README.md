# Astrarium 🌌

Your productivity fuels the stars.

Astrarium turns your daily learning and tasks into light that grows a celestial companion.  
Each completed challenge feeds your alien pet, helping it evolve from Sprout → Bloom → Constellation.

---

## Overview

Astrarium is an AI-powered, gamified productivity app designed to make skill retention personal and fun.  
As you learn and complete challenges, you earn “starlight” that keeps your alien alive and glowing.  
It’s spaced repetition, adaptive learning, and gamification — all in one interactive universe.

## Inspiration

We wanted to solve a universal frustration: forgetting what we’ve already learned.  
Astrarium was inspired by the idea that consistency should feel kind — not forced.  
We built it to make long-term learning emotionally engaging, not transactional.

---

## How We Built It

- **Frontend:** Built with Next.js and TypeScript for clean, modular components.  
- **Backend:** FastAPI manages user data, task tracking, and AI logic.  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL stores tasks, progress, and reflection data.  
- **Design:** Tailwind CSS and custom animations create a smooth, celestial feel.  

---

## Challenges

- Balancing gamification with gentle motivation.  
- Integrating multiple frameworks in a monorepo.  
- Designing smooth, responsive UI interactions for pet evolution and animation.

---

## What We Learned

- How to structure full-stack apps efficiently in a monorepo.  
- How emotional design principles drive user retention.  
- How small UI details make or break engagement.

---

## Future Plans

- Add daily reminders and real-time browser notifications.  
- Connect to external APIs to track new skills automatically.  
- Expand AI personalization for even smarter review timing.
