## Inspiration

We wanted to solve a universal frustration: forgetting what we‚Äôve already learned.  
Astrarium was inspired by the idea that consistency should feel kind ‚Äî not forced.  
We built it to make long-term learning emotionally engaging, not transactional.

---

## How We Built It

- **Frontend:** Built with Next.js and TypeScript for clean, modular components.  
- **Backend:** FastAPI manages user data, task tracking, and AI logic.  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL stores tasks, progress, and reflection data.  
- **Design:** Tailwind CSS and custom animations create a smooth, celestial feel.  

---

## Challenges

- Balancing gamification with gentle motivation.  
- Integrating multiple frameworks in a monorepo.  
- Designing smooth, responsive UI interactions for pet evolution and animation.

---

## What We Learned

- How to structure full-stack apps efficiently in a monorepo.  
- How emotional design principles drive user retention.  
- How small UI details make or break engagement.

---

## Future Plans

- Add daily reminders and real-time browser notifications.  
- Connect to external APIs to track new skills automatically.  
- Expand AI personalization for even smarter review timing.
